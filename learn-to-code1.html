    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>In this course, I learned about the following programming concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Commands</strong>: Instructions given to a computer to perform specific tasks, such as `print` in Python or `System.out.println` in Java.</li>
      <li><strong>For Loops</strong>: Control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times, such as `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)` in Java.</li>
      <li><strong>Conditionals</strong>: Statements that allow the execution of code based on certain conditions, like `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements that execute different code blocks based on logical conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Logical Operators</strong>: Symbols used to perform logical operations, such as `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT), to combine or invert boolean expressions.</li>
      <li><strong>Variables</strong>: Named storage locations in memory used to hold data that can be manipulated throughout a program, such as `int age = 25;` in many programming languages.</li>
      <li><strong>Types</strong>: Classification of data that specifies what kind of value a variable can hold, such as integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), or strings (`String`).</li>
      <li><strong>Initialization</strong>: The process of assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of its creation, like `int count = 0;` in programming.</li>
      <li><strong>Functions</strong>: Blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks and can be called with a name, such as `void printMessage()` in Java or `def greet()` in Python.</li>
      <li><strong>Parameters</strong>: Variables passed into functions to provide input values that the function can use, such as `void add(int a, int b)` where `a` and `b` are parameters.</li>
    </ul>
