            <h2>About the Settings Page</h2>
            <p>In Week 4, we introduced a new Settings Page to our San Diego History App. This page provides users with the ability to customize their app experience according to their preferences. Whether itâ€™s adjusting the theme, modifying text size, or setting up your personal profile picture, this new feature aims to make the app more user-friendly and personalized.</p>

            <!-- Updates in the current version of the app -->
            <h2>Settings Options Available This Week</h2>
            <p>This week, we've added several new options to the Settings Page:</p>
            <div class="updates">
                <div class="update-item">
                    <h3><strong>Enable Dark Mode</strong></h3>
                    <p>Users can now switch to Dark Mode to reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments. This option changes the app's interface to darker tones, providing a comfortable viewing experience at night.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Toggle dark mode on and off in the settings based on your preference or time of day.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="update-item">
                    <h3><strong>Edit Text Size</strong></h3>
                    <p>The app now allows you to adjust the text size, making it easier to read. You can increase or decrease the font size for better readability, catering to different visual preferences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you find the text too small or too large, use this option to find the perfect size!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="update-item">
                    <h3><strong>Edit Time Zone</strong></h3>
                    <p>Users can now set their preferred time zone. This ensures that any time-based features, such as events or notifications, reflect the correct time for your location.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to adjust this setting if you travel to different time zones or want to stay updated on local events.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="update-item">
                    <h3><strong>Reset to Default Settings</strong></h3>
                    <p>If you've made too many changes and want to start over, you can now reset all settings back to their default state with just one click. This feature is perfect for users who want to restore the original app experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use this option if you're unsure about the changes you've made and want to return to the original settings.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="update-item">
                    <h3><strong>Create Your Own Profile Picture (PFP)</strong></h3>
                    <p>Users can now upload their own profile picture (PFP) to personalize their app experience. This feature helps you create a more individualized profile within the app.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose an image that represents you or your favorite San Diego landmark!</p>
